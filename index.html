<i>build decentralized cross site services with browser apis today</i>


<p>
	Browser resources such as localStorage, IndexedDB, and WebAuthn follow the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy">"same-origin policy"</a> and are locked to a particular domain. This makes it difficult to create decentralized services that are meant to work across different websites. 
</p>

<p>
	With caddr.org, the "origin" is defined by the content of the code that is being run, serving as a credibly neutral platform for building shared resources.
</p>


<h3>what can you do with caddr.org?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>build a cross-site decentralized identity system powered by WebAuthn</li>
	<li>create a metamask-like ethereum wallet that works on all browsers without having to install any extensions</li>
	<li>store an web-wide scavenger hunt where people can collect items from different websites</li>
	<li>creating a system for sharing data between interactive widgets across different apps</li>
	<li>check and fall back on the integrity of several untrusted ipfs gateways</li>
</ul>

<h3>how does caddr.org work?</h3>
<p>
	caddr.org simply returns a page which consists of a script tag with whatever "src" is passed in through the query string, and an "integrity" attribute that corresponds to the base64-encoded version of the subdomain it is loaded from. 
</p>

<p>
	for example
</p>

<pre>https://<span style="color: green">jyhensccrcfgezcf6f46ea6fxbrc7ul44kzlc2vrx63od64a47jq</span>.caddr.org/?src=<span style="color:  blue;">https://caddr-origin.github.io/examples/hello-world/demo.js</span></pre>

<p>
	loads a page that contains
</p>

<pre>
&lt;script
  integrity="<span style="color: green">sha256-Tg5GyEKIimJkRfF54gPFuGIv0XzisrFqsb+24fuA59M=</span>"
  src="<span style="color:  blue;">https://caddr-origin.github.io/examples/hello-world/demo.js</span>"&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>
	Note that the embedding website is still "responsible" for hosting the contents of the script that is to be loadedâ€” none of the scripts are hosted on caddr.org.
</p>

<p>
	If you examine the source code of an actual page, you'll see that it's slightly different from what is described above. The script tags are generated dynamically in Javascript so that it can fall-back to several potential sources in the case of failure. 
</p>

<h3>security</h3>

<p>
	Ultimately we would like browsers to natively implement resolvers for urls that are in the format of <tt>*.caddr.org</tt>, similar to existing built-in pages such as <tt>about:blank</tt>. If you work on a browser, or know anyone who does, help towards native implementations would be much appreciated!
</p>
<p>
	Since October 11, 2023, *.caddr.org has been added to the <a href="https://hstspreload.org/?domain=caddr.org">HSTS Preload List</a> which will force it to be loaded with HTTPS. 
</p>
<p>
	A <a href="https://github.com/caddr-origin/browser-extension">browser extension</a> has been developed to serve as an additional layer of security that guards against compromises of the caddr.org domain. 
</p>

<p>
	We would like to get <tt>caddr.org</tt> added to the <a href="https://publicsuffix.org/">public suffix list</a>, help on putting together a submission would also be appreciated. 
</p>
<p>
	The domain has been renewed ahead of time for 10 years, but as a piece of web infrastructure, it might be ideal if stewardship could be transferred to a credible organization. 
</p>

<p>
	
</p>
<p>
	At some point in the future, it may be possible that vulnerabilities are discovered in SHA-256 that compromise its viability as the basis for a content-addressing scheme. However the only other browser-supported hashing schemes SHA-386 and SHA-512 are not viable alternatives given the maximum length of a subdomain is 63 letters (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt">RFC-1035</a>). This is also what necessitates the current base32 encoding (as regular hexadecimal would require 64 letters). 
</p>

<h3>get started</h3>

<p>
	Below is a simple tool where you can paste in the URL for some script file and it will automatically hash the contents and redirect you to the equivalent content-addressed caddr.org page. 
</p>

<form method="GET" action="/">
	<input type="url" name="src" placeholder="https://caddr-origin.github.io/examples/hello-world/demo.js" style="width: 300px" />
	<button type="submit">Go</button>
</form>

<p>
	Alternatively, you can manually calculate the subdomain from a local file by running the following shell script. 
</p>

<pre>
sha256sum FILENAME.js | awk '{ print $1 }' | xxd -r -p | base32 | sed 's/=//g'
</pre>

<script>
	async function getHash32(url){
		let n = new Uint8Array(await fetch(url).then(k => k.arrayBuffer(), err => {
			alert('Unable to fetch the contents of ' + url + '\n\nThis is likely due to a missing Access-Control-Allow-Origin CORS header.')
		}).then(k => crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', k)))
			.reduce((acc, k) => acc * 256n + BigInt(k), 0n) * 256n**3n / 32n**3n, res = ''
		while ((n /= 32n) !== 0n) res = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz234567'[Number(n % 32n)] + res;
		return res
	}
	const srcUrl = new URLSearchParams(location.search).get('src');
	if(srcUrl){
		getHash32(srcUrl).then(hash32 => {
			location.href = 'https://' + hash32 + '.caddr.org/' + 
				location.search
				.replaceAll('%3A', ':')
				.replaceAll('%2F', '/')
		})
	}
</script>

<p title="if the linked list were assigned to a variable named `web` then one might be tempted to call this web[3]">
	The name is pronounced "kuh-duh-dur" as traditional in the lisp community for the abbreviation of <tt>(car (cdr (cdr x)))</tt> which returns the third item in a linked list.
